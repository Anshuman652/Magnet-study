<h4 style="text-align: center; border: solid #ffffff; background-color: LightGreen;color: #ffffff">The Barnyard Duck</h4>
&nbsp;<br>
<p1>A flock of wild ducks were flying in formation, heading south for the winter. They formed a
beautiful V' in the sky, and were admired by everyone who saw them from below, One day,
Willy, one of the wild ducks in the formation, spotted something on the ground that caught
his eyes It was a barnyard with a flock of tame ducks who lived on the farm.
<img style="float: left;height: 200px;width: 200px;margin-right: 10px;margin-bottom: 5px;"  src="IMG_20201008_140908.jpg">
They were waddling around on the ground, quacking merrily and eating corn that was thrown on the
ground for them everyday Willy liked what he saw. "It sure would be nice to have some of
that corn", he thought to himself. "And all this flying is very tiring. I'd like to just waddle
around here for some time." So after thinking it over a while, Willy left the formation of wild
ducks, made a sharp dive to the left, and headed for the barnyard. He landed among the
tame ducks. He began to waddle around and quack merrily. He also started eating corn. The
formation of wild ducks continued their journey towards south, but Willy didn't care. I'll
rejoin them when they come back north in a few months", he said to himself Several months
went by and sure enough, Willy looked up and spotted the flock ofwild ducks in formation,
heading north. They looked beautiful up there. By now Willy was tired of the barnyard. It was
muddy everywhere he waddled. "It's time to leave", said Willy. So Willy flapped his wings
furiously and tried to get airborne. During this months at the barnyard Willy had gained
some weight from all his corn-eating, and he hasn't exercised his wings much either. After a
great effort he finally got off the ground, but he was flying too low and slammed into the
side of the barn. He fell to the ground with a thud and said to himself "Oh, well, I'll just wait
until they fly south in a few months. Then I'll rejoin them and become a wild duck again." But
when the flock flew overhead once more after a few months, Willy again tried to lift himself
out of the barnyard. He simply didn't have the strength. Every winter and every spring, he
saw his wild duck friends flying overhead, and they would call out to him. But his attempts to
leave the barnyard were all in vain. Eventually Willy no longer paid any attention to the wild
ducks flying overhead. He hardly even noticed them. He had, after all, become a barnyard
duck.</p1>&nbsp;<br>

<h4 style="text-align: center; border: solid #ffffff; background-color: LightGreen;color: #ffffff">Panch Parmeshwar</h4>
&nbsp;<br>`
<p2>The friendship of Alagu Choudhary and Jumman Sheikh was a household example in their
village Jumman was a staunch Muslim and Alagu was a devout Hindu. But they thought on
the same wavelength. Khalajaan was Jumman's rich, widowed aunt. She came to live with
him as she had no other relative than him. She, in a bout of affection, transferred all her
property in his name. Initially, Jumman's wife Kariman also looked after her with great
affection and care. But slowly her attitude changed towards Khalajaan and it brought a
change in the attitude of Jumman also. As time passed, their behaviour changed from good
to bad and bad to worse towards her. Kariman started taunting Khalajaan and didn't give
her two square meals gladly One day Khalajaan called Jumman and asked him to pay her a
monthly allowance as she was finding it difficult to live with them. She was going hungry
almost everyday. She wanted to run a separate kitchen for herself.<br>
<img style="float: left;height: 200px;width: 200px;margin-right: 10px;margin-bottom: 5px;"  src="IMG_20201008_141051.jpg">
 When Jumman showed his inability to pay her any amount she became angry and threatened to call a Panchayat.
"Please, do by all means", said Jumman as he was also irritated by these daily bickerings
Jumman was sure of winning at the Panchayat, because he was popular with the villagers
and no one would go against him, if it came to taking sides between him and his aunt. Old
Khalajaan moved from one house in the village to the other for several days garnering
support for her case. At last, she went to Alagu Choudhary and pleaded with him to be
present on the day the Panchayat was to be held.He agreed on the condition that he would
remain a silent spectator as Jumman was his closest friend Khalajaan asked Alagu "Is your
friendship more important than your integrity?" Alagu did not say anything but her
comment made him think. The Panchayat day arrived Khalajaan narrated her tales of woes
to those assembled and declared that she would abide by the Panchayats verdict. Panchayat
asked Jumman, "Whom do you want to appoint as Sarpanch, Jumman?" "Let Khalajaan
choose the Sarpanch as she has asked for a Panchayat", he said in anger Khalajaan stressed,
"The members of the Panchayat are no one's friends or enemies." "If you do not trust
anyone else, you trust Alagu Choudhary, don't you?" She emphasised. "Well, let Alagu
Choudhary be my Sarpanch" Jumman was delighted in his heart He couldn't ask for a better
choice. But to show his unconcern, he said, "How does it matter if it be Ramdhan or Alagu?"
At this Algu Chaudhary said, "Khalajaan, you know Jumman is my friend." But Khalajaan
reposing her faith in him said, "A Panch is above friendship and enmity. It is God that speaks
through a Panch Alagu, after being appointed Sarpanch, addressed Jumman. "You and I are
old friends and we have always been helpful to each other. But before the Panchayat,
Khalajaan and you are equal. You are at liberty to plead your case, as you want." Jumman
didn't take Alagu's impartial posture seriously. But, he still addressed the Panchayat
gracefully and gave his version of the story, Alagu was also not devoid of tactfulness in
questioning Alagu's pointed questions were addressed to Jumman to shift the truth from the
untruth. But Jumman felt that Alagu was bent upon ruining their friendship. When Alagu
announced the Panchayats verdict, it was Jumman Sheikh, after carefully examining the
points made by you and your Khalajaan, the panchayat has come to the conclusion that you
must give Khalajaan a monthly maintenance allowance. You can afford to pay her out of the
profits you get from her property.
<img style="float: right ;height: 200px;width: 200px;margin-left: 10px;margin-bottom: 5px;"  src="IMG_20201008_141110.jpg"
style="float: right;">
 If you think the profits are not enough to do so, you are at liberty to return her property."Jumman felt utterly let down by Algu verdict. He broke his
friendship with Alagu instantly, Jumman's thirst for revenge on Alagu intensified within him.
It was not long before he got a chance to get even with Alagu. Alagu had bought a pair of
bullocks a year back, but one of the bullocks died As Alagu found it hard to get a
replacement for the dead bullock, he thought it better to sell the surviving one. He sold it to
Sanjhu Sahu who agreed to pay in a month's time Sanjhu Sahu made the bullock pull his
overloaded cart three-four times a day to and fro the market He did not give the bullock
sufficient time to recover his strength. One day when the bullock had already pulled
overloaded cart to the market and had been back many times, Sanjhu Sahu finally
doubleloaded the cart. This time the bullock found it hard to pull. He collapsed and died onthe spot. For some weeks thereafter, Alagu didn't remind Sanjhu Sahu for the payment. At
last when he asked Sanjhu Sahu to make the payment, he bluntly refused saying, "You sold
me a half-dead animal. Alagu knew he had sold him a fit and healthy bullock and Sanjhu
Sahu was telling a lie by calling the animal as half-dead. It was Sanjhu Sahu himself who had
not looked after the bullock. They were about to come to blows, when some villagers
suggested, "Let a Panchayat be called to resolve the matter." Without a moment's thought,
Sanjhu appointed Jumman Sheikh as Sarpanch Alagu did not like it but kept his poise As
soon as Jumman Sheikh took the position of a Sarpanch, a strange sense of responsibility
dawned on him. He thought, "I'm now the arbiter of truth and justice. I must stick fast to the
truth and not allow prejudice to take the upper hand." After hearing arguments from both
Sanjhu Sahu and Alagu Choudhary, he pronounced the Panchayat verdict. "It is only proper
that Sanjhu Sahu should pay Alagu Choudhary the full price of his bullock as he had agreed
to. The animal when sold was fit and healthy, and died due to the overwork and insufficient
food. It is upto Alagu Choudhary to reduce the price if he chooses so. As for punishing Sahu
for ill-treating the animal, it is beyond the jurisdiction of the Panchayat", announced Jumman
Sheikh. Alagu Choudhary never expected Jumman Sheikh to pronounce a judgement in his
favour and 50 he couldn't help shouting, joyously. 'Panch Parmeshwar ki Jai!Thus, both the
friends were reunited. Jumman embraced Alagu Choudhary as he used to do before and
said, "Bhaiyya, after you were Sarpanch at Khalajaan's Panchayat, I had become your bitter
enemy. But today I have realised that for a 'Panch', enmity and friendship are not significant;
what matters is truth and justice. The voice of Panch Parmeshwar is the voice of God." Thus,
they became friends as they were before.</p2>
